# Nix for MacOS + NixOS
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/usrbinkat/nixos-config?style=plastic)

# Overview
Hey, you made it! Welcome. 🤓 

Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and Unix systems that ensures reproducible, declarative, and reliable software management. 

This repository contains configuration for a general-purpose development environment that runs on MacOS, NixOS, or both simultaneously. 

I use it daily on my 🧑🏻‍💻 M1 Macbook Pro and an x86 PC in my home office. It also runs as a VM on your Mac. Others have reported that it's working for them too.

Check out the starter templates and step-by-step commands below to get started!

# Installing
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note: Nix 2.18 currently [has a bug](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/9052) that impacts this repository.

For now, if you run into errors like this:
```
error: path '/nix/store/52k8rqihijagzc2lkv17f4lw9kmh4ki6-gnugrep-3.11-info' is not valid
```

Run `nix copy` to make the path valid.
```
nix copy --from https://cache.nixos.org /nix/store/52k8rqihijagzc2lkv17f4lw9kmh4ki6-gnugrep-3.11-info
```

## For MacOS
I've tested these instructions on a fresh Macbook Pro as of September 2023.

### 1. Install dependencies
```sh
xcode-select --install
```

### 2. Install Nix
Thank you for the installer, [Determinate Systems](https://determinate.systems/)!
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

### 3. Initialize a starter template
This is a simplified version without secrets management.
```sh
mkdir -p nixos-config && (cd nixos-config && nix flake --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' init -t github:usrbinkat/nixos-config#starter)
```

This is a full version with secrets management.
```sh
mkdir -p nixos-config && (cd nixos-config && nix flake --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' init -t github:usrbinkat/nixos-config#starterWithSecrets)
```

### 4. Apply your current user info
Run this script to replace stub values with your username, full name, and email.
```sh
chmod +x bin/apply && bin/apply
```

### 5. Decide what packages to install
You can search for packages on the [official NixOS website](https://search.nixos.org/packages).

**Review these files**

* `darwin/casks`
* `darwin/packages`
* `darwin/home-manager`
* `nixos/packages`
* `shared/packages`

### 6. Optional: Setup secrets
If you are using the starter with secrets, there are a few additional steps.

#### 6a. Create a private Github repo to hold your secrets
In Github, create a private [`nix-secrets`](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nix-secrets-example) repository. You'll enter this name during installation.

#### 6b. Install keys
Before generating your first build, these keys must exist in your `~/.ssh` directory. Don't worry, we provide a few commands to help you.

| Key Name            | Platform         | Description                           | 
|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| id_ed25519          | MacOS / NixOS    | Used to download secrets from Github. |
| id_ed25519_agenix   | MacOS / NixOS    | Used to encrypt and decrypt secrets.  |

You must one run of these commands:

##### Copy keys from USB drive
This script auto-detects a USB drive connected to the current system.
> Keys must be named `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519_agenix`.
```sh
nix run github:usrbinkat/nixos-config#copyKeys
```

##### Create new keys
```sh
nix run github:usrbinkat/nixos-config#createKeys
```

##### Check existing keys
If you're rolling your own, just check they are installed correctly.
```sh
nix run github:usrbinkat/nixos-config#checkKeys
```

### 7. Install configuration
First-time installations require you to move the current `/etc/nix/nix.conf` out of the way.
```sh
[ -f /etc/nix/nix.conf ] && sudo mv /etc/nix/nix.conf /etc/nix/nix.conf.before-nix-darwin
```

If you're using a git repository, only files in the working tree will be copied to the [Nix Store](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix-store). 

So it's imperative you run `git add .`.

Then, run `bin/build`, which wraps a few Nix commands to build and deploy a new Nix generation.
```sh
chmod +x bin/darwin-build && chmod +x bin/build && bin/build
```

## For NixOS
This configuration supports both `x86_64` and `aarch64` platforms.

### 1. Burn the latest ISO
Download and burn [the minimal ISO image](https://nixos.org/download.html) to a USB, or create a new VM with the ISO as base.
> Note, if you're building a VM on an Apple Silicon Mac, choose [64-bit ARM](https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-23.05/latest-nixos-minimal-aarch64-linux.iso).

**Quick Links**

* [64-bit Intel/AMD](https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-23.05/latest-nixos-minimal-x86_64-linux.iso)
* [64-bit ARM](https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-23.05/latest-nixos-minimal-aarch64-linux.iso)

Boot the installer.
### 2. Optional: Setup secrets
If you are using the starter with secrets, there are a few additional steps.

#### 2a. Create a private Github repo to hold your secrets
In Github, create a private [`nix-secrets`](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nix-secrets-example) repository. You'll enter this name during installation.

#### 2b. Install keys
Before generating your first build, these keys must exist in your `~/.ssh` directory. Don't worry, we provide a few commands to help you.

| Key Name            | Platform         | Description                           | 
|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| id_ed25519          | MacOS / NixOS    | Used to download secrets from Github. |
| id_ed25519_agenix   | MacOS / NixOS    | Used to encrypt and decrypt secrets.  |

You must one run of these commands:

##### Copy keys from USB drive
This script auto-detects a USB drive connected to the current system.
> Keys must be named `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519_agenix`.
```sh
<<<<<<< HEAD
sudo nix run --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:dustinlyons/nixos-config#copyKeys
=======
nix run --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:usrbinkat/nixos-config#copyKeys
>>>>>>> e9eaad3 (renameing in fork)
```

##### Create new keys
```sh
sudo nix run --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:usrbinkat/nixos-config#createKeys
```

##### Check existing keys
If you're rolling your own, just check they are installed correctly.
```sh
sudo nix run --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:usrbinkat/nixos-config#checkKeys
```

### 3. Install configuration
#### Run command
After the keys are in place, you're good to go. Run either of these commands:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Nvidia cards, select the second option, `nomodeset`, when booting the installer, or you will see a blank screen.

> [!WARNING]
> Running this will reformat your drive to the ext4 filesystem.

**Simple**
```sh
sudo nix run --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:usrbinkat/nixos-config#install
```

**With secrets**
```sh
sudo nix run --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:usrbinkat/nixos-config#installWithSecrets
```

### 4. Set user password
On first boot at the login screen:
- Use the shortcut `Ctrl-Alt-F2` (or `Fn-Ctrl-Option-F2` if on a Mac) to move to a terminal session
- Login as `root` using the password created during installation
- Set the user password with `passwd <user>`
- Go back to the login screen: `Ctrl-Alt-F7`

# How to create secrets
To create a new secret `secret.age`, first [create a `secrets.nix` file](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix#tutorial) at the root of your `nix-secrets` repository. This will only be used by the `agenix` CLI command. 

**secrets.nix**
```nix
let
  user1 = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIL0idNvgGiucWgup/mP78zyC23uFjYq0evcWdjGQUaBH";
  users = [ user1 ];

  system1 = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIPJDyIr/FSz1cJdcoW69R+NrWzwGK/+3gJpqD1t8L2zE";
  systems = [ system1 ];
in
{
  "secret.age".publicKeys = [ user1 system1 ];
}
```
Next, run the 'create secret' command. It assumes your SSH private key is in `~/.ssh/` or you can provide the `-i` flag with a path to your `id_ed25519` key. 
```
EDITOR=vim nix run github:ryantm/agenix -- -e secret.age
```
This opens an editor to accept, encrypt, and write your secret to disk. 

Commit the file to your `nix-secrets` repo and add a reference in the `secrets.nix` of your `nix-secrets` repository. References look like
```
{
  "secret.age".publicKeys = [ user1 system1 ];
}
```
where `"secret.age"` is your new filename.

## Example
So, let's say I wanted to create a new secret to hold my Github SSH key. 

I would `cd` into my `nix-secrets` repo directory, verify the `agenix` configuration (named `secrets.nix`) exists, then run 
```
EDITOR=vim nix run github:ryantm/agenix -- -e github-ssh-key.age
```

This would start a `vim` session.

I would enter insert mode `:i`, copy+paste the key, hit Esc and then type `:w` to save it, resulting in the creation of a new file, `github-ssh-key.age`.

Next, I would edit `secrets.nix` to include a line specifying the public key to use for my new secret. I specify a user key, but I could just as easily specify a host key.

**secrets.nix**
```nix
let
  dustin = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIL0idNvgGiucWgup/mP78zyC23uFjYq0evcWdjGQUaBH";
  users = [ dustin ];
  systems = [ ];
in
{
  "github-ssh-key.age".publicKeys = [ dustin ];
}
```

Then I'd commit all changes to the `nix-secrets` repository, go back to my `nixos-config` and run `nix flake update` to update the lock file.

Now, all that's left is [using the secret](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/3b95252bc6facd7f61c6c68ceb1935481cb6b457/nixos/secrets.nix#L28) in my configuration.

# Live ISO
Not yet available. Coming soon.

```sh
nix run --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:usrbinkat/nixos-config#live
```

# Deploying changes to your system
With Nix, changes to your system are made by 
- editing your system configuration
- building the [system closure](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/closures)
- creating and switching to it _(i.e creating a [new generation](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Terms_and_Definitions_in_Nix_Project#generation))_

## For MacOS
```sh
nix build .#darwinConfigurations.macos.system && \
./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#macos
```
#### Optional [script](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/bin/darwin-build) to save keystrokes
```sh
bin/build
```
## For NixOS
Choose the flake target for your platform.
```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#x86_64-linux
```
```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#aarch64-linux
```
#### Optional [script](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/bin/nixos-build) to save keystrokes
```sh
bin/build
```

## Update dependencies
```sh
nix flake update
```

## Compatibility and Testing
This configuration has been tested and confirmed working on the following platforms:
- M1 Apple Silicon
- Bare metal x86_64 PC
- NixOS inside VMWare on MacOS
- MacOS Sonoma inside Parallels on MacOS

## Appendix
### Why Nix Flakes
**Reasons to jump into flakes and skip `nix-env`, Nix channels, etc**
- Flakes work just like other package managers-- `npm`, `cargo`, `poetry`, `composer`, etc.
- Flakes encapsulate not just project dependencies, but Nix expressions, Nix apps, and other configurations in a single file. It's all there.
- Channels lock all packages to one big global `nixpkgs` version. Flakes lock each package to specific versions, which is a higher level of precision and reproducibility compared to channels.
- Flakes have a growing ecosystem (See [Flake Hub](https://flakehub.com/) or [Dev Env](https://devenv.sh/)), so you're future-proofing yourself.

Just go flakes. Make it easier on yourself.
